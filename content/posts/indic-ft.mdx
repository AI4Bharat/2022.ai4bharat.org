[fastText](https://fasttext.cc/) is a subword-aware word embedding model. It is particularly well-suited for Indian languages due to their highly agglutinative morphology. We train fastText models on our IndicNLP Corpora and evaluate them on a set of tasks to measure its performance.

Our fastText models are available for 11 Indian languages: Assamese, Bengali, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu.

### Usage

To use our fastText models, first [download them](https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/indicft/#downloads). Next, install the fastText library:

```
pip3 install fasttext

```

and then load the models like this:

```
import fasttext
model = fasttext.load_model(path_to_binary_file)

```

For instructions on how to use these models, please refer to the official [fastText documentation](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/support.html)
