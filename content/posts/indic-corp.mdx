IndicCorp has been developed by discovering and scraping thousands of web sources - primarily news, magazines and books, over a duration of several months.

IndicCorp is one of the largest publicly-available corpora for Indian languages. It has also been used to train our released models which have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many tasks.

### Corpus Format

The corpus is a single large text file containing one sentence per line. The [publicly released version](https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/corpora/#downloads) is randomly shuffled, untokenized and deduplicated.

### Downloads

\* Excluding articles obtained from the OSCAR corpus

### Processing Corpus

For processing the corpus into other forms (tokenized, transliterated etc.), you can use the [indicnlp library](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic\_nlp\_library). As an example, the following code snippet can be used to tokenize the corpus:

```
from indicnlp.tokenize.indic_tokenize import trivial_tokenize
from indicnlp.normalize.indic_normalize import IndicNormalizerFactory

lang = 'kn'
input_path = 'kn'
output_path = 'kn.tok.txt'

normalizer_factory = IndicNormalizerFactory()
normalizer = normalizer_factory.get_normalizer(lang)

def process_sent(sent):
    normalized = normalizer.normalize(sent)
    processed = ' '.join(trivial_tokenize(normalized, lang))
    return processed

with open(input_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as in_fp,\
	 open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as out_fp:
    for line in in_fp.readlines():
        sent = line.rstrip('\n')
        toksent = process_sent(sent)
        out_fp.write(toksent)
        out_fp.write('\n')



```
