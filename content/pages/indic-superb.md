      # IndicSUPERB


      ***


      IndicSUPERB is a robust benchmark consisting of 6 speech language
      understanding (SLU) tasks across 12 Indian languages.  The tasks include
      automatic  speech recognition, automatic speaker verification, speech
      idntification, query by example and keyword spotting. The IndicSUPERB also
      encompasses Kathbath dataset which has 1684 hours of labelled speech data
      across 12 Indian Languages.      &#x20;
