    headline: Language Understanding
    text: >
      Understanding language is central to building intelligent applications
      that can interface with users, help make sense of large amount of text
      data and provide insights. This requires basic building blocks like named
      entity recognizers, questions answering systems, sentiment analyzers,
      intent-analysis modules, etc. To enable these tasks, foundational language
      models which can understand language are required. At AI4Bharat, our goal
      is to build these foundational language models as we as high-quality
      datasets and models for central NLU tasks.&#x20;

          Word embeddings for 11 Indian languages trained on IndicCorp. The
          embeddings are based on the fastText model and are well suited for the
          morphologically rich nature of Indic languages.
