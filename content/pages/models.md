#           IndicLID, is a language identifier for all 22 Indian languages listed
#           in the Indian constitution in both native-script and romanized text.
#           IndicLID is the first LID for romanized text in Indian languages. It
#           is a two stage classifier that is ensemble of a fast linear classifier
#           and a slower classifier finetuned from a pre-trained LM. It can
#           predict 47 classes (24 native-script classes and 21 roman-script
#           classes plus English and Others).

#           IndicTrans2 is the first open-source transformer-based multilingual
#           NMT model that supports high-quality translations across all the 22
#           scheduled Indic languages â€” including multiple scripts for low-resouce
#           languages like Kashmiri, Manipuri and Sindhi. It adopts script
#           unification wherever feasible to leverage transfer learning by lexical
#           sharing between languages. Overall, the model supports five scripts
#           Perso-Arabic (Kashmiri, Sindhi, Urdu), Ol Chiki (Santali), Meitei
#           (Manipuri), Latin (English), and Devanagari (used for all the
#           remaining languages).

#           A multilingual single-script transformer based model for translating
#           between English and Indian languages. This model is trained using the
#           Samanantar corpus and at the time of its release was the state of the
#           art open source model as evaluated on Facebook's FLORES benchmark.

#           This model is trained using Aksharantar corpus and at the time of its
#           release was the state of the art open source model as evaluated on
#           Google's Dakshina benchmark and our Aksharantar benchmark.

#           IndicWav2Vec is a multilingual speech model pretrained on 40 Indian
#           langauges. This model represents the largest diversity of Indian
#           languages in the pool of multilingual speech models. We fine-tune this
#           model for downstream ASR for 9 languages and obtain state-of-the-art
#           results on 3 public benchmarks, namely MUCS, MSR and OpenSLR.

#           fastText is a well-suited model for Indian languages because of their
#           rich morphological structure. We pre-train and benchmark fastText
#           embeddings on our corpora, producing embeddings that outperform the
#           official fastText embeddings for Indian languages on a variety of
#           tasks.

#           To improve performance and coverage of Indian languages on a wide
#           variety of tasks, we also develop and evaluate IndicBERT. IndicBERT is
#           a multilingual ALBERT model (a lighter variant of BERT) pre-trained on
#           12 major Indian languages: Assamese, Bengali, English, Gujarati,
#           Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu. It
#           provides state-of-the-art performance on some of the tasks.
