          fastText is a well-suited model for Indian languages because of their
          rich morphological structure. We pre-train and benchmark fastText
          embeddings on our corpora, producing embeddings that outperform the
          official fastText embeddings for Indian languages on a variety of
          tasks.

          To improve performance and coverage of Indian languages on a wide
          variety of tasks, we also develop and evaluate IndicBERT. IndicBERT is
          a multilingual ALBERT model (a lighter variant of BERT) pre-trained on
          12 major Indian languages: Assamese, Bengali, English, Gujarati,
          Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu. It
          provides state-of-the-art performance on some of the tasks.

          IndicBART is a multilingual, sequence-to-sequence pre-trained model
          focusing on Indic languages and English. It currently supports 12
          languages and is based on the mBART architecture.

          IndicTrans is a Transformer-XL model trained on samanantar dataset.
          Two models are available which can translate from Indic to English and
          English to Indic. The model can perform translations for 11
          lanaguages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam,
          Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu.

        text: >
          IndicWav2Vec is a multilingual speech model pretrained on 40 Indian langauges. This model represents the largest diversity of Indian languages in the pool of multilingual speech models. We fine-tune this model for downstream ASR for 9 languages and obtain state-of-the-art results on 3 public benchmarks, namely MUCS, MSR and OpenSLR.
