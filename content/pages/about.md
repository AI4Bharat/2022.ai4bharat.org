      # The Case for AI4Bharat


      ###### India is a civilisation of the ages, but with significant
      socio-economic challenges currently. AI4Bharat is a community created to
      build AI solutions to solve Indiaâ€™s problems, today.&#xD;&#xA;AI4Bharat is
      built around four functions: **Discover, Educate, Build and Comment**. We
      believe that the pace of innovation in AI for good can be significantly
      increased by systematising the process of **problem discover**y and
      **solution engineering**. In addition, there is need for **education** and
      **robust commentary.**


      Our group focuses on building NLP ecosystem for Indian languages and
      seeking new models and techniques better suited for Indian languages. Our
      project has volunteers from IIT Madras, One Fourth Labs, Microsoft Search
      Technology Center India.
