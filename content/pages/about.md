      # The Case for AI4Bharat


      ###### India is a civilisation of the ages, but with significant
      socio-economic challenges currently. AI4Bharat is a community created to
      build AI solutions to solve Indiaâ€™s problems, today.&#xD;&#xA;AI4Bharat is
      built around four functions: **Discover, Educate, Build and Comment**. We
      believe that the pace of innovation in AI for good can be significantly
      increased by systematising the process of **problem discover**y and
      **solution engineering**. In addition, there is need for **education** and
      **robust commentary.**
