      Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC) is a comprehensive and publicly
      available parallel corpus that includes both existing and new data for all
      22 scheduled Indic languages. It is comprised of two parts: BPCC-Mined and
      BPCC-Human, totaling approximately 230 million bitext pairs. BPCC-Mined
      contains about 228 million pairs, with nearly 126 million pairs newly
      added as a part of this work. On the other hand, BPCC-Human consists of
      2.2 million gold standard English-Indic pairs, with an additional 644K
      bitext pairs from English Wikipedia sentences (forming the BPCC-H-Wiki
      subset) and 139K sentences covering everyday use cases (forming the
      BPCC-H-Daily subset). It is worth highlighting that BPCC provides the
      first available datasets for 7 languages and significantly increases the
      available data for all languages covered.
