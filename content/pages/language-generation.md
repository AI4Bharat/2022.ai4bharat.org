    headline: Language Generation
    text: >
      AI systems that can generate natural language text can aid users in a
      variety of writing tasks like summarization, headline/caption generation, 
      paraphrasing, grammar correction, question generation as well as support
      tasks like dialog and machine translation. To support these usecases for
      Indian languages, we are working on building foundational language models,
      datasets and task-specific models for power language generation
      applications.
