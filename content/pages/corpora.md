  - body: "# IndicCorp\n\n***\n\nIndicCorp has been developed by discovering and scraping thousands of web sources - primarily news, magazines and books, over a duration of several months.\n\nIndicCorp is one of the largest publicly-available corpora for Indian languages. It has also been used to train our released models which have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many tasks.\n\n### Corpus Format\n\nThe corpus is a single large text file containing one sentence per line. The\_[publicly released version](https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/corpora/#downloads)\_is randomly shuffled, untokenized and deduplicated.\n"

  - body: "### Processing Corpus\n\nFor processing the corpus into other forms (tokenized, transliterated etc.), you can use the\_[indicnlp library](). As an example, the following code snippet can be used to tokenize the corpus:\n\nLanguage\n\n```\nfrom indicnlp.tokenize.indic_tokenize import trivial_tokenizefrom indicnlp.normalize.indic_normalize import IndicNormalizerFactory\nlang = 'kn'input_path = 'kn'output_path = 'kn.tok.txt'\nnormalizer_factory = IndicNormalizerFactory()normalizer = normalizer_factory.get_normalizer(lang)\ndef process_sent(sent):    normalized = normalizer.normalize(sent)    processed = ' '.join(trivial_tokenize(normalized, lang))    return processed\nwith open(input_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as in_fp,\\\t open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as out_fp:    for line in in_fp.readlines():        sent = line.rstrip('\\n')        toksent = process_sent(sent)        out_fp.write(toksent)        out_fp.write('\\n')\n\n\n\n```\n\n### Citing\n\nIf you are using IndicGLUE, please cite the following article:\n\nLanguage\n\n```\n@inproceedings{kakwani2020indicnlpsuite,    title={{IndicNLPSuite: Monolingual Corpora, Evaluation Benchmarks and Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Indian Languages}},    author={Divyanshu Kakwani and Anoop Kunchukuttan and Satish Golla and Gokul N.C. and Avik Bhattacharyya and Mitesh M.
