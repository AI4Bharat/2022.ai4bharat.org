  - body: "# IndicCorp\n\n***\n\nIndicCorp has been developed by discovering and scraping thousands of web sources - primarily news, magazines and books, over a duration of several months.\n\nIndicCorp is one of the largest publicly-available corpora for Indian languages. It has also been used to train our released models which have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many tasks.\n\n### Corpus Format\n\nThe corpus is a single large text file containing one sentence per line. The\_[publicly released version](https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/corpora/#downloads)\_is randomly shuffled, untokenized and deduplicated.\n\n### Processing Corpus\n\nFor processing the corpus into other forms (tokenized, transliterated etc.), you can use the\_[indicnlp library](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic\\_nlp\\_library). As an example, the following code snippet can be used to tokenize the corpus:\n\n```\nfrom indicnlp.tokenize.indic_tokenize import trivial_tokenize\nfrom indicnlp.normalize.indic_normalize import IndicNormalizerFactory\n\nlang = 'kn'\ninput_path = 'kn'\noutput_path = 'kn.tok.txt'\n\nnormalizer_factory = IndicNormalizerFactory()\nnormalizer = normalizer_factory.get_normalizer(lang)\n\ndef process_sent(sent):\n    normalized = normalizer.normalize(sent)\n    processed = ' '.join(trivial_tokenize(normalized, lang))\n    return processed\n\nwith open(input_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as in_fp,\\\n\t open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as out_fp:\n    for line in in_fp.readlines():\n        sent = line.rstrip('\\n')\n        toksent = process_sent(sent)\n        out_fp.write(toksent)\n        out_fp.write('\\n')\n\n\n\n```\n\n### Citing\n\nIf you are using IndicGLUE, please cite the following article:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{kakwani2020indicnlpsuite,\n    title={{IndicNLPSuite: Monolingual Corpora, Evaluation Benchmarks and Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Indian Languages}},\n    author={Divyanshu Kakwani and Anoop Kunchukuttan and Satish Golla and Gokul N.C. and Avik Bhattacharyya and Mitesh M.
