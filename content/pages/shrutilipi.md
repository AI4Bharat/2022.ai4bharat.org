      ## Shrutilipi - Mining Process


      We summarize the key procedure we used for mining audio-text pairs from
      documents from the AIR dataset in the figure below. For a detailed
      description of the data mining process, please refer to our
      [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12666 "paper").
