          A lot of NLP models require a large amount of training data, which
          most of the Indian languages lack. In this project, we develop a
          large-scale Indic corpora by intensively crawling the web. The corpora
          that we build has a total of 8.9 billion tokens and covers 12 major
          Indian languages - making it the largest public corpus for most of the
          Indian languages.
