          A lot of NLP models require a large amount of training data, which
          most of the Indian languages lack. In this project, we develop a
          large-scale Indic corpora by intensively crawling the web. The corpora
          that we build has a total of 8.9 billion tokens and covers 12 major
          Indian languages - making it the largest public corpus for most of the
          Indian languages.

          The largest publicly available parallel corpora collection for Indic
          languages containing ∼46.9M parallel sentences between English and 11
          Indic languages, ranging from 142K pairs between English-Assamese to
          8.6M pairs between English-Hindi. Of these 34.6M pairs are newly mined
          as a part of this work.

          The largest publicly available parallel transliteration corpora
          containing 26M word pairs spanning 21 languages mined from Wikidata,
          Samanantar and IndicCorp. It also contains a challenging and diverse
          benchmark for evaluating transliteration models.
