          In this paper, we introduce NLP resources for 11 major Indian
          languages from two major language families. These resources include:
          (a) large-scale sentence-level monolingual corpora, (b) pre-trained
          word embeddings, (c) pre-trained language models, and (d) multiple NLU
          evaluation datasets (IndicGLUE benchmark). The monolingual corpora
          contains a total of 8.8 billion tokens across all 11 languages and
          Indian English, primarily sourced from news crawls. The word
          embeddings are based on FastText, hence suitable for handling
          morphological complexity of Indian languages. The pre-trained language
          models are based on the compact ALBERT model. Lastly, we compile the
          (IndicGLUE benchmark for Indian language NLU. To this end, we create
          datasets for the following tasks: Article Genre Classification,
          Headline Prediction, Wikipedia Section-Title Prediction, Cloze-style
          Multiple choice QA, Winograd NLI and COPA. We also include publicly
          available datasets for some Indic languages for tasks like Named
          Entity Recognition, Cross-lingual Sentence Retrieval, Paraphrase
          detection, etc. Our embeddings are competitive or better than existing
          pre-trained embeddings on multiple tasks. We hope that the
          availability of the dataset will accelerate Indic NLP research which
          has the potential to impact more than a billion people. It can also
          help the community in evaluating advances in NLP over a more diverse
          pool of languages. The data and models are available at
          https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org.
