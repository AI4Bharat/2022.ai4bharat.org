          Large language models have demonstrated the capability to perform well
          on many NLP tasks when the input is prompted with a few examples
          (in-context learning) including machine translation, which is the
          focus of this work. The quality of translation depends on various
          features of the selected examples, such as their quality and
          relevance. However, previous work has predominantly focused on
          individual features for example selection. We propose a general
          framework for combining different features influencing example
          selection. We learn a regression function that selects examples based
          on multiple features in order to maximize the translation quality. On
          multiple language pairs and language models, we show that our example
          selection method significantly outperforms random selection as well as
          strong single-factor baselines reported in the literature. Using our
          example selection method, we see an improvement of over 2.5 COMET
          points on average with respect to a strong BM25 retrieval-based
          baseline.
