    headline: Machine Translation
    text: >
      ###### India has 22 constitutionally recognised languages with a
      collective speaker base of over 1 billion speakers. With increasing
      digital penetration and the preference for regional language content on
      the web, a good translation system is a necessity to provide equitable
      access to information and content. For example, educational videos for
      primary, secondary and higher education should be available in different
      Indic languages. Similarly, various government advisories, policy
      announcements, high court judgments, etc. should be disseminated in all
      major regional languages. Despite this fundamental need, the accuracy of
      machine translation (MT) systems to and from Indic languages are poorer
      compared to those for several European languages. At AI4Bharat, our goal
      is to bridge this gap by (i) mining cheaper parallel data from the web
      (ii) manually collecting a small amount of seed data (iii) creating robust
      India-centric benchmarks and (iv) building efficient multilngual models
      which exploit the similarity between Indian languages.

          The largest publicly available parallel corpora collection for Indic
          languages containing âˆ¼46.9M parallel sentences between English and 11
          Indic languages, ranging from 142K pairs between English-Assamese to
          8.6M pairs between English-Hindi. Of these 34.6M pairs are newly mined
          as a part of this work.
