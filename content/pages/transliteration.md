      ###### Indian languages are written in a variety of scrits, *viz., *Brahmi
      family of abugida scripts, Arabic-derived abjad scripts&#xA;and even
      Alphabetic Roman script. This diversity makes it challenging to support
      mechanisms which are convenient for&#xA;typing or creating content in
      these diverse&#xA;languages and scripts. Historically, Roman&#xA;and
      related scripts have been widely supported&#xA;across multiple platforms
      and device form factors for digital content creation. While native
      language keyboards are available in many&#xA;Indic languages, most people
      are comfortable&#xA;with the Roman keyboard. While romanized input offers
      a convenient&#xA;solution for certain interactions, it does not&#xA;solve
      the problem of input in the native script.&#xA;An optimal solution that
      users find beneficial&#xA;is automatic transliteration of the
      romanized&#xA;input into the native script. Hence, at Ai4Bharat, we have
      undertaken the task of creating large-scale transliteration corpora for
      Indic languages along with models for transliteration of romanized inputs
      into native script.
