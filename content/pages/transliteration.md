    headline: Machine Transliteration
    text: >
      Indian languages are written in a variety of scripts (Brahmi family of
      abugida scripts, Arabic-derived abjad scripts

      and even Alphabetic Roman script). This diversity makes it challenging to
      support mechanisms which are convenient for

      typing or creating content in these diverse

      languages and scripts. Most Indian users are  comfortable with the Roman
      keyboard and thus

      an optimal solution that users find beneficial

      is automatic transliteration of the romanized

      input into the native script. To enable this, at AI4Bharat, we have
      undertaken the task of creating large-scale transliteration corpora for
      Indic languages along with models for transliteration of romanized inputs
      into native script.
